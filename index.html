          <p>
            Our affinity diagram consists of four clusters: Technology, Costs, Accessibility, and People.
            The technology cluster pertains to the basic functionality of the project, the costs cluster pertains to the potential financial barriers
            and revenue streams generated by the project, the accessibility cluster pertains to how users will interact with the project, and the people cluster
            pertains to how content will be curated/moderated for the user.
